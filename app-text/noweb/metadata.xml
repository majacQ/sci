	<longdescription lang="en">noweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while remaining as simple as possible. Its primary advantages are simplicity, extensibility, and language-independenceâ€”especially noticeable when compared with other literate-programming tools. noweb uses 5 control sequences to WEB's 27. The noweb manual is only 4 pages; an additional page explains how to customize its LaTeX output. noweb works ``out of the box'' with any programming language, and supports TeX, latex, HTML, and troff back ends. A back end to support full hypertext or indexing takes about 250 lines; a simpler one can be written in 40 lines of awk. The primary sacrifice relative to WEB is that code is seldom prettyprinted.
