         1. This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement
            between you (either an individual person or a single legal
            entity, who will be referred to in this EULA as "End User", and
            GSL Biotech LLC ("GSL") for the SnapGene software product
            ("Software") or SnapGene Viewer software product ("Freeware")
            that accompanies this EULA, including any associated media,
            printed materials and electronic documentation.
         2. The Software or Freeware also includes any software updates,
            add-on components, web services and/or supplements that GSL may
            provide to End User or make available to End User after the date
            End User obtains the initial copy of the Software or Freeware, to
            the extent that such items are not accompanied by a separate
            license agreement or terms of use. By installing, copying,
            downloading, accessing or otherwise using the Software or
            Freeware, End User agrees to be bound by the terms of this EULA.

            discretion, GSL may provide limited support through email or

            registration number, and grants End User a limited,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable license as outlined in Sections
            2.d through Section 2.g and in Section 3.

            (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY.
         4. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY GSL SHALL

            WARRANTY PROVIDED HEREIN.
         5. (USA only) SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
            WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO END USER.
            THIS WARRANTY GIVES END USER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND END USER
            MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

    6. Exclusive Remedy

       End User's exclusive remedy is to return the Software to GSL. Provided
       that any non-compliance with the above warranty is reported in writing
       to GSL no more than ninety (90) days following delivery to End User,
       GSL will use reasonable commercial efforts to supply End User with a
       replacement copy of the Software that substantially conforms to
       published specifications, provide a replacement for defective media,
       or refund to End User the purchase price for the Software, at its
       option. GSL shall have no responsibility if the Software has been
       altered in any way, or if the media has been damaged by misuse,
       accident, abuse, modification or misapplication. Any such misuse,
       accident, abuse, modification or misapplication of the Software will
       void the warranty above. THIS REMEDY IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

            OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY,
            TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN
            IF GSL OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN
            IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
         2. GSL'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO END USER FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR ANY
            CAUSE WHATSOEVER WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT END USER PAID FOR

            USER MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO
            STATE.
